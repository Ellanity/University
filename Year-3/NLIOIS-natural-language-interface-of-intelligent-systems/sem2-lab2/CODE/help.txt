All work in the system takes place on the main page.
It is divided into 3 parts:
On the left there are buttons for performing operations;
In the center is a window with a word that is updated when the user uses the available operations.
On the right is the source text window.
@
Standard view when the user is working with the program.

A bit more about available functions.
First button "Load PDF file" allows you to select a pdf file from the user's device, after which the text from the selected file is placed in the window with the main text.
Second button "Process data" converts all the text in the main text window into a morpheme dictionary, for each morpheme there is a list of tags. The part of speech in tags is filled in automatically.

User can enter the rest of the data independently, as well as edit the existing ones. It also displays the number of times this morpheme occurs in the text, amenable to changes by the user.

To remove a morpheme from the dictionary, you need to enter the "#" character at the beginning of the morpheme line (as shown in the picture above).
To add a morpheme, you just need to write it to a new line in the specified morpheme format.

In order for user changes to be applied to the dictionary, you need to confirm the changes by clicking the "Apply updates" button

The system ("Filter" button) allows you to sort the resulting dictionary by parts of speech (by the first tag of morphemes). Below is an example of the filter execution.
Only filtered entries are displayed in the dictionary window, but the dictionary is in the program's memory. To restore the appearance of all entries, you need to select the "all" filter.
@
The "Save in file" button allows you to save the created dictionary in csv format, which supports many other programs for working with data.

@
The "search word" button in tandem with the text input window above it, allows you to find all morphemes containing the specified text. To display all morphemes, you need to perform a search with an empty text input window.
The "Apply updates" button, as previously mentioned, confirms user changes in the dictionary window and updates this window, displaying the modified sorted dictionary.
